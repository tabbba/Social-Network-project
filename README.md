# Social Network Analysis (SNA) Project: Exploring the Titanic Dataset

## Project Overview

### group member
the minds behind this social network analysis journey in the Titanic's network are: Leonardo Azzi, Sofia Bruni, Francesca Romana Sanna, Alexandra Tabarani, and Marta Torella.

Welcome to the repository of our Social Network Analysis (SNA) project, where we delve into exploring the intricate web of relationships and interactions among characters from the Titanic dataset. Throughout the course weeks, we aim to not only visually represent these connections but also analyze them through various graph metrics.

*Title: Unveiling Titanic's Social Fabric: A Network Analysis*

*Introduction:*

In our Social Network Analysis (SNA) project, the characters aboard the Titanic take center stage as nodes, while the edges connecting them represent shared scenes, their weights reflecting the frequency of these shared appearances. This analytical approach allows us to decode the complex web of interactions that shaped the destinies of the movie characters.

Through meticulous examination, we aim to uncover not only the characters but also the subtle patterns of connection that underscore the narrative. Moreover, our goal is to enrich our network with previously undiscovered information.

Join us as we navigate the network to understand the Titanic's social dynamics!
